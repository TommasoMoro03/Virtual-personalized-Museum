<h3>Virtual personalized museum</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to allow users to have an immersive experience in the art. Through a voice-to-voice interaction, users can express their feelings to the system, 
which will show them famous paintings based on their input.</p>
<p>The aim is to simulate a virtual museum, so the "tourist" starts from an empty room without paintings and, as he asks and get feedback, he is redirected to other rooms of the museum, 
with a short vocal description that simulates the guide of the museum.</p>

<h5><b>How does it work?</b></h5>
<p>We use these technologies for this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FastAPI: allows us to connect Python code with frontend</li>
  <li>LangChain: it's used to retrieve information from various sources, such as the CSV dataset. We use the OpenAI API Key</li>
  <li>CSS: to give style to the room. (credits: <a href="https://codepen.io/ivorjetski/pen/gOPOvdB">https://codepen.io/ivorjetski/pen/gOPOvdB</a>)</li>
